Virtual Nursing Skills Lab (CAVE) is an immersive 3D training experience built in Unity for large-scale, multi-wall immersive environments. The project simulates a hospital wardroom where users can explore a realistic clinical space and interact with medical assets in a room-scale setting, designed to support nursing education and experiential learning.

The experience is built using the Immersive Interactive SDK, allowing the scene to be rendered across multiple physical surfaces (Left, Centre, Right, Back, and optional Floor) to create the feeling of standing inside the room itself. Users can navigate the environment using a virtual room simulator during development, or experience the full projection-mapped version inside an immersive lab.

Care has been taken to ensure proper real-world scale, camera alignment, and surface mapping so that objects appear consistent and believable across walls. The project is intended as a foundation for future interactive scenarios such as patient assessment, equipment familiarization, and procedural walkthroughs.

If you would like to run the experience inside an immersive environment, please see the Usage section for build and runtime instructions.
